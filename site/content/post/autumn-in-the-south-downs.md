Having spent a large majority of my walking adventures in the Lake District, exploring the hills of Blencathra and Helvellyn, and enjoying melt-in-the-mouth spiced gingerbread in Grasmere, I had somewhat neglected the rolling beauty of the South Downs until last week. So too had I failed to realise the ease at which they are accessed from London; just a little over  an hour and a half on the train from London Bridge gets you to Eastbourne, the end point of the South Downs trail starting in Winchester. Thus, when my friend outlined the parameters for our adventures - three days of walking somewhere easily accessible, 'good for the soul', and relatively easy going (us both being new to multiple-day hiking with all our gear) - the South Down National Park was a clear winner.

Opting to finish our walk at Eastbourne, and enjoy sea views on our approach to the 19th century resort town, we worked backwards to figure out where to begin our adventure. Another factor in this decision was that I had also enjoyed the Seven Sisters cliff walk - which we would end with - back in December, and was enthusiastic to experience this again (and hopefully in slightly less blustery weather!). After some research, I found that starting at the YHA in Truleigh Hill, and breaking the journey in Lewes and then Alfriston, would give us a pleasant amount of walking to fill three days. 

Hostels and Bed and Breakfasts booked (a surprisingly easy and relatively cheap feat in the October off-season), we headed down to Brighton on Monday afternoon, catching the 15:35 train. After arriving, we pottered along the seafront and pier before stumbling across Riddle & Finns, a characterful, candle lit restaurant specialising in all things fishy. After soaking in the warm atmosphere and enjoying a delicious meal, we booked a taxi up to the YHA in Truleigh Hill, where we drank tea, played Cluedo, and felt the anticipation for our little adventure build.

**Day One - YHA Truleigh Hill to Alfriston (via Devil's Dyke)**

After enjoying a pot of instant porridge and some spectacular views from the hostel kitchen, we set off bright and early, hitting the trail by eight o'clock, and enjoying the best of a clear, albeit unusually warm, October morning. We were immediately struck by the vibrant greens of the softly rolling landscape, fields stretching as far as the eye could see, and clusters of trees few and far between in these heavily grazed planes.

Our first day of walking was a 'softly undulating' 25km, taking us past the infamous natural beauty spot, the Devil's Dyke. Featuring stunning panoramic views of the surrounding countryside, the dyke - a highlight of the South Downs trail - is the deepest and longest dry dyke in the UK, and indeed, much mystery surrounds this impressive spot. Legend reports that the dyke was dug by the Devil in order to drown the Christian settlers in the Weald, and maintains that if you venture to the bottom of the dyke and run backwards seven times around the two humps at the bottom, the Devil himself will be summoned. Regrettably, we did not find time within our itinerary to test if this was true. 

Shortly after passing the dyke, we came across a local rambling group, who warned of 'hills ahead' in-between friendly greetings and encouraging smiles. Our (limited) uphill efforts were rewarded with more far reaching views of the Downs, and our first glimpse of the South East coast. We also stumbled across a horse cart, now converted into a mobile caf√©, and enjoyed a much appreciated cup of tea in the most scenic, ambient setting. Unexpected cuppas are often the best, and this was no less true on a sunny Tuesday morning.

We enjoyed a  late lunch of bread a cheese at a quiet spot by a small pond, watching sky larks dance above the shallows, and sheltering from the sun under a weather worn tree. We then continued, beginning the long and gradual ascent into the Lewes (and passing Black Cap along the way). We arrived at The Dorset, our home for the night, a little after 5pm, and after a cup of tea and a quick shower, headed out for noodles and a couple of games of pool.

**Day Two - Lewes to Alfriston (via Cows!)**

![](img/day-2-cow-field.jpeg)

There was a definite theme to our second day of walking, and that was: cows. As someone who grew up on horror stories of human-crushing cows, and surrounded by family members each with their own terrible tale, I am, to put it lightly, 'not the biggest fan'. However, the route we took from Alfriston in the morning (which deviated from the South Downs trail, taking us along the river Ouse before re-joining the path at the next YHA hostel) involved walking through a bull field, and then *right through* a cluster of milk cows. I am unashamed to say some serious hand holding was needed, but I overcame (at least for the day) some of my cow prejudices. Indeed, throughout the day there were several instances where crossing through cow fields was unavoidable, and for the most part, it seems that they are completely unbothered by passing wanderers, being used to the summertime South Downs traffic.

Cows aside, day two was a gentle 20km, with this shorter distance allowing us time in the morning to visit the Owl Flint Bakery, (a small, independent bakehouse with a Nordic feel, and delicious pastries and coffee). Fuelled by almond croissants, we enjoyed a flat start, before returning, with a gentle ascent, to the South Downs trail proper. We were treated throughout the day to panoramic views of the surrounding countryside and the coast as we drew nearer to Alfriston, for the most part having the path to ourselves (again, save for a few cows). When we did come across a fellow trail walker- or cyclist, as was often the case- part of the magic of the path was the total dissolving of unnatural, yet normal, social boundaries. In London, strangers are to be, at best, ignored, and if one is to stop and smile - or god forbid, start up a conversation - they are sadly in a minority (and often treated with caution). On the trail, the reverse is true - and how wonderful it is to chat to strangers, sharing stories and bound by a mutual love of exploring the beaten path. 

After stopping for lunch at another breath taking view, we found ourselves very quickly descending into Alfriston, and checking into our hotel, the Dean's Place (called 'posh' by one of the cyclists we had spoken to earlier in the day, but reasonably priced in the off season!). We discovered that a local film club was hosting a 'dinner and film' of Alfred Hitchcock's *Rear Window*, an evening which couldn't have been more perfectly designed for us (and, in particular, Katherine). And so we spent the second evening of our adventure, sitting in a little room in the upstairs of the pub, sipping on peppermint tea, and watching one of my favourite films. 

**Day Three - Alfriston to Eastbourne (via Seven Sisters)**

![](img/day-3-coastlines.jpeg)

On our final day we were to hike along the Seven Sisters, which Katherine was excited to experience, having heard great things from her parents (and not to be outdone!). Weather still miraculously fair, we set off mid morning after a delicious breakfast of poached eggs and muffins (a Nutella sachet also commandeered by myself as compensation for the disrupted night's sleep we had experienced that night, being moved rooms in the early hours due to a noisy party directly below our original one). 

Stopping for a cup of tea once we had reached the Seven Sisters visitor's centre, Katherine and I soon became aware of a growing buzz of people arriving. As we set off towards the cliffs, we found ourselves in the throng of a charity walk- and what a wonderful amount of people had turned up! As we weaved through the crowds, we chatted to one of the volunteers from Mountain Rescue, and heard about his experience running his first ultramarathon (a feat that seems to be growing in popularity!). 

As we arrived at the first 'sister', we found the group broke up on the up hills, and the path immediately felt less crowded. The white cliffs and sea views were never ending, and the salty air and sea breeze pleasantly refreshing. It was a wonderful stretch to finish our adventure on, and as we drew nearer to Eastbourne, I felt saddened that our trail was coming to an end. A couple of times, I suggested that we maybe 'extend our walk to Hastings' under the guise of a joke, but in actuality being completely serious. After only a few days of nomadic living, spending our days walking and evenings playing borrowed board games in hostels and BnBs, I had fallen into the routine of long-distance walking. The thought that we would be travelling by train to London the next day was not conducive to this new reality- it was alien and strange, and sounded all too much like hard work! Nevertheless, we had lives to return to (and blisters to attend!). 

We arrived in Eastbourne a little before dusk, and ravenously hungry for the fish and chips we had been dreaming about all that afternoon. After a quick pit stop at the hotel to freshen up, we headed to LJ's for some takeaway dinner to eat on the seafront. It might've been because we were hungry and had been walking all day, but Katherine and I both agreed that the fish and chips we had that evening were some of the best we had ever eaten in our lives- and coming from a coastal area, a well rounded knowledge of chippie  establishments is something I pride myself on! Listening to the tide lulling peacefully in and out as we munched our way through vinegary potato and salty cod, the first stars beginning to appear in the clear night sky, I felt so thankful for this life's unexpected adventures, precious friendships, and waterproof of walking boots.
