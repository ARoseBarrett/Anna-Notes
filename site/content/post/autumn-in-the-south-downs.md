Having spent a large majority of my walking adventures in the Lake District, exploring the hills of Blencathra and Helvellyn, and enjoying melt-in-the-mouth spiced gingerbread in Grasmere, I had somewhat neglected the rolling beauty of the South Downs until last week. So too had I failed to realise the ease at which they are accessed from London; just a little over  an hour and a half on the train from London Bridge gets you to Eastbourne, the end point of the South Downs trail starting in Winchester. Thus, when my friend outlined the parameters for our adventures - three days of walking somewhere easily accessible, 'good for the soul', and relatively easy going (us both being new to multiple-day hiking with all our gear) - the South Down National Park was a clear winner.

Opting to finish our walk at Eastbourne, and enjoy sea views on our approach to the 19th century resort town, we worked backwards to figure out where to begin our adventure. Another factor in this decision was that I had also enjoyed the Seven Sisters cliff walk - which we would end with - back in December, and was enthusiastic to experience this again (and hopefully in slightly less blustery weather!). After some research, I found that starting at the YHA in Truleigh Hill, and breaking the journey in Lewes and then Alfriston, would give us a pleasant amount of walking to fill three days. 

Hostels and Bed and Breakfasts booked (a surprisingly easy and relatively cheap feat in the October off-season), we headed down to Brighton on Monday afternoon, catching the 15:35 train. After arriving, we pottered along the seafront and pier before stumbling across Riddle & Finns, a characterful, candle lit restaurant specialising in all things fishy. After soaking in the warm atmosphere and enjoying a delicious meal, we booked a taxi up to the YHA in Truleigh Hill, where we drank tea, played Cluedo, and felt the anticipation for our little adventure build.

After enjoying a pot of instant porridge and some spectacular views from the hostel kitchen, we set off bright and early, hitting the trail by eight o'clock, and enjoying the best of a clear, albeit unusually warm, October morning. We were immediately struck by the vibrant greens of the softly rolling landscape, fields stretching as far as the eye could see, and clusters of trees few and far between in these heavily grazed planes.
