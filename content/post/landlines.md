A book which has inspired me recently is *Landlines*, by Raynor Winn. An extraordinary story of one couple’s continued defiance in the face of a devastating degenerative disease diagnosis, this book follows the stunning events of its prequel, *The Salt Path*, as Winn invites her readers once again out of the comfort of their homes, and onto the beaten track. The story picks up in the middle of the global pandemic, as Raynor’s lockdown wanderlust, and deep fear for her husband, Moth’s, rapidly declining mental and physical state, leads her to one solution: walking the 230 mile Cape Wrath trail of North West Scotland. Indeed, if the Winn’s attempt on this notoriously challenging route was not awe-inspiring enough, the unlikely effects on Moth as the duo weave through hills, glens, and never-ending bog, crossing borders and ever-extending their path- in spite of blistered feet and a broken finger- will leave readers in wondrous disbelief. This very human story of determination against all odds, combined with Winn’s thoughtful commentary on the tangible effects of the Climate Crisis, creates a rich, thought provoking narrative, encouraging us to look both inwards and outwards, and towards our beautiful, fragile, wild places.
