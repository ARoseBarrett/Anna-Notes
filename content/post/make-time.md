Indeed, Creators of Google Ventures' design sprint and co-authors of Make Time, Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky posit within this short book a four-step daily framework "that anyone can use to systematically design their days around things that matter" (Knapp and Zeratsky, 2018:p.3). Featuring 87 techniques which readers are invited to try out, reflect upon, and scrap or keep, Knapp and Zeratsky present that; "This is a book about slowing down the crazy rush. It's about making time for things that matter. Make time is not about productivity (...) Instead, it's a framework designed to help you actually create more time in your day for the things you care about..." (ibid:p.10). Worth the read, then. 

From the first pages, the tone and structure of the book makes for a good-humoured, easy going read, with the addition of humble illustrations adding a further element of warmth. While ostensibly suggesting nothing overwhelmingly 'ground breaking' (indeed, Knapp and Zeratsky do not claim the featured techniques to be anything extraordinary), the ideas in the book are actually rather more useful; through encouraging simple, seemingly obvious techniques such as deleting social media apps off your phone, or logging out of twitter to make it harder to mindlessly scroll, one becomes suddenly more aware of how often one is using those apps. If we are so clued-up on how damaging and time consuming this mindless scrolling is, why are we still doing it? Through calling out the behaviour and suggesting simple, quick fixes, Knapp and Zeratsky make the reader more accountable for their own time wasting behaviours, while simultaneously providing a safe, non-judgemental space for reflection- we've all been there, right?

One of the ideas in the book which I found most pertinent was that of 'defaults'; for example, the default that work meetings run to the half hour or hour, regardless of whether the content of said meeting requires that exact amount of time (it rarely does). This was applied in a very literal sense as well to the devices we spend our lives on, which by default barrage us constantly with notifications and tempting home-screen 'Infinity Pool' apps. Indeed, this concept of 'Infinity Pools' (any kind of app or media which acts as a continuous source of refreshable, constantly accessible information) and the additional idea of the 'Busy Bandwagon' (the pressure to be constantly busy, constantly accessible, and constantly consuming and creating content) was yet another example of how the book, through naming the obvious, makes it easier to spot these problematic habits in our daily lives. After reading, I find myself much more self aware of 'Infinity Pools', and, for example, and how truly draining they are in every sense, not just in relation to time. Make Time has also encouraged me to be more reflective of how I feel after the activity of scrolling mindlessly for 10 minutes through. If the purpose of the activity isn't clear, and it doesn't spark joy, then why do it?

Ultimately, Make Time is worth the read as much for reflective purposes as it is for taking away any kind of practical, tactile strategy to combat that feeling of mounting work-load and pressure. This said, the four-step framework suggested by the authors is something I have already started applying to my daily life, finding its emphasis of finding and blocking protected time to complete a daily 'Highlight' incredibly useful for structuring and ensuring the day has a clear focus and purpose. The accompanying ideas, that once a 'Highlight' has been identified, one must create the conditions for 'Laser' focus- emphasising in this the need to 'Energize' appropriately- and then 'Reflect' on what worked well for that day, make for a useful blueprint for one to re-examine their lives, and consider how, by making a few simple switches, we really can Make Time.
