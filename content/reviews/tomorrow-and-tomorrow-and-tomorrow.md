'Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow' is unlike any other story I have ever read, and I utterly devoured it. While Zevin's cross-decade storyline is reminiscent of David Nicholl's 'One Day' and John Boyne's 'The Heart's Invisible Furies' (books which I also adored in their separate ways), the backdrop to Sam and Sadie's tale is quite unique. Spanning from the early 1980s over a period of thirty years, 'Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow' is as much about human coming of age as it is about the young video game industry finding its feet at the end of the 20th century. The references to various games interweaved throughout this story- both real and made up- creates a common point of reference for the reader, and a warm undertone of nostalgia. 

Upon researching Zevin's background, I was surprised to find she didn't have any direct experience in video game development, so detailed and intimate are her descriptions of this. Indeed, at points in the book, her writing reminded me strongly of the recounts featured in Jason Schreier's 'Blood, Sweat, and Pixels', a non-fiction tell-all of the nitty gritty of game development and crunch time. That this book is referenced in her bibliography was not a surprise, informing the technical prose interwoven in the book.

Ultimately, 'Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and tomorrow' offers something for everyone.
