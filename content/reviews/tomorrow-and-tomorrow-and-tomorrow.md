'Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow' is unlike any other story I have ever read, and I utterly devoured it. While Zevin's cross-decade storyline is reminiscent of David Nicholl's 'One Day' and John Boyne's 'The Heart's Invisible Furies' (books which I also adored in their separate ways), the backdrop to Sam and Sadie's tale is quite unique. Spanning from the early 1980s over a period of thirty years, 'Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow' is a story about coming-of-age, both for human beings, and the video game industry. The references to various games interweaved throughout this story- both real and made up- creates a common point of reference for the reader, and a warm undertone of nostalgia. 

Upon researching Zevin's background, I was surprised to find she didn't have any direct experience in video game development, so detailed and intimate are her descriptions of this. Indeed, at points in the book, her writing reminded me strongly of the recounts featured in Jason Schreier's 'Blood, Sweat, and Pixels', a non-fiction tell-all of the nitty gritty of game development and crunch time. That this book is referenced in her bibliography was not a surprise, and informs the technical prose interwoven in the book. Zevin is able to describe the production of fictional games with stark realism, and pitches concepts to the reader which inspire them to pick up a controller, and start playing!

Ultimately, 'Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow' offers something for everyone, and in my opinion, is a great gateway novel for those more non-fictionally minded, tech-interested readers into fiction. While I felt that certain romantic developments were unnecessary, bordering on obvious, and was disappointed by some elements of the storyline in the latter half of the book, I nevertheless raced through every page up until the bitter end. I'm greatly anticipating Zevin's next book, and, failing that, perhaps her debut in the video game industry?
